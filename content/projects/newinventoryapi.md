# Updated InventoryAPI system

Project 2 recreates the inventory API system using mroe powerful and common technology, specifically laravel, docker, hugo, and github.io

Laravel, docker, and scripts code can be found in github.com/lincolnr2/newAPI

With laravel, the api system is simpler to setup and easier to use, as well as being faster and more secure. Docker also allows for containerization so it works on any device.
